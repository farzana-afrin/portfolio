                <h2>Farzana Afrin</h2>
                <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see
                    , and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to
                    talk,
                    I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night;
                    I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
                    I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment
                    when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer,
                    leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
                    I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’
                    noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.
                    I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.
                    I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. </p>
